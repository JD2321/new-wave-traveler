                <p>“From a young age, Louis had detested the Louvre, the royal palace in Paris that has been the seat of French government since the Middle Ages. He has assumed the throne at five years old, and a year later, he has been forced to flee Paris after an angry mob broke into the Louvre and demanded to see their child king. ‘(Louis in his bed chamber feigned sleep, and the mob left after simply looking at him.)’But the episode made Louis feel unsafe in the Louvre. This , in 1661, when he was 23 years old of age, he began construction of a new residence in the small town of Versailles” (Sayre 733).</p>
