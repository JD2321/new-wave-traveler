            <h3>This short narrative pieces uncovers the complexities of body image, voyeurism, women travelers, and the archetype of the Goddess.</h3>

                <p class="quote">“From a young age, Louis had detested the Louvre, the royal palace in Paris that has been the seat of French government since the Middle Ages. He has assumed the throne at five years old, and a year later, he has been forced to flee Paris after an angry mob broke into the Louvre and demanded to see their child king. ‘(Louis in his bed chamber feigned sleep, and the mob left after simply looking at him.)’But the episode made Louis feel unsafe in the Louvre. This , in 1661, when he was 23 years old of age, he began construction of a new residence in the small town of Versailles” (Sayre 733).</p>

                    <p>Sex, shells, crimson, and red high heels: King Louis XIV Royal Baroque Court was the epicenter of lavish spending, personal sense of grandeur, and an endless line of mistresses, debts, and illegitimate children. Louis XIV--The Sun King is seen in every nook and cranny of the chateau from oil paintings emblazoned in gaudy gold's to allegorical figurines of Apollo. What was is about this man’s vanity that captivated women? It was the money, fame, and lavish black curls as depicted in his official state portrait by Rigaud-- an astute 63-year-old man at 5’4 boasting his slender tight-fitted legs with personally designed red heels. This man exudes over-compensation to the next iota.</p>

                <p>I took a deep breath and inhaled a mixture of body odor masked in heavy floral perfume. We were in King Louis bedchamber where years of antiquity that laid out before me. I couldn’t appreciate the painting for as long as I had wanted to. I had it etched into my memory from my Sayre Humanities books and sleepless nights studying for exams. I was stuffed in a hot red room, skin sticky and burned from the Sun itself on that August day. 13 miles from the City of Paris I had tanned my skin and burned my scalp while standing in line for 2 hours with my friend Sarah.</p>

                            “You know why this place was built right?” “Nah” she had said. “It’s because some creep walked in on the King sleeping when he was five so his rich family was like ‘Fuck that! Time to build a 700 hundred-roomed château in the middle of nowhere away from these plebs!’”

                <p>She laughed a barbaric yawp, the type that vibrated in her throat. Sarah was a stout Southern girl, a proud Tarheel, and my travel buddy. Our travels were always steeped in inside jokes and glances we made at each other when people were acting like idiots. We had a hive mind of sarcasm. She had this trip planned months in advance, but due to unforeseen circumstances plans had changed with her travel buddy. With no travel insurance and a thirst to get away she reached out to me: “Wanna take a break and come to Paris, Brussels, and Amsterdam with me.” I was totally in. At the time, my life was crumbling around me. My brother had died unexpectedly 4 months prior to this trip. I wanted a break from my family, and I was quite tired of being the middleman, the sound-minded and level-headed person in it. “Where was my rock?” I’d think to myself every night. Well, he had died, and I just wanted respite from my overly complicated transition.</p>

                <p>My white tank top had yellow pit stains, and my teddy bear tattoo on my left arm had darkened. I was attempting my best to sway with the rhythm of the endless lines and group tours in foreign tongues. I went with the flow, meshed myself in, but lost sight of Sarah. As I turned I was in a sea of 40 Asian tourist that had entered in their group tour all with selfie sticks, fanny packs, and black hair. I caught site of her by her mane of blonde hair that stuck out like my northern star. I tapped her on the shoulder and she was relieved it was me. We made it all the way to Versailles from a 40-minute train ride, standing, and eyes oogling us up and down. It reminded me of standing at the sidelines of P.E. class in 5th grade and being picked last for kick-ball because I was bigger. Although, this was 20 years later, a train full of strangers eager to explore the same destination reeled me back to the uncomfortableness I felt growing up. Did I look bad? Are they judging me? Do my arms look bad? Man, I wish I lost weight before this trip.</p>
                <p>We were jettisoned into different rooms throughout the chateau like a pack of sardines. Each room had a theme: King Louis, Marie Antoinette, The French High Court, Baroque, Rococo, The Sun, Sex, and Venus. Salon De Venus was also known as the King’s State Apartment. Venus’s voluptuous yet baby-soft appearance was illustrated on the ceiling as the Goddess of Love. She sat upon a cloud surrounded by cherubs and admired by the great Gods of the Greek Pantheon. Her blue gown is lowered to her waist exposing her bosoms and her pudgy and delicate arms. I wanted a picture, but It was impossible. I had it with the heat, the claustrophobia, my skin sticking to strangers’ skin, the sweat, the way my stomach was squeezed and taut up against my jeans, the grief weight I had put on from 4 months ago, my stretch marked arms, and my decrepit knees! Oh, how I loved to berate myself, and Sarah joined in as well. I told her to shut-up, because everything she was saying about herself wasn’t true.</p>

                <div class="quote-bar"></div>

                <p>We stood there with our heads cocked upright for some time as others squeezed by pushing us to advance into the other corridor. Venus sat there highlighted by pastel blues and her womanly figure.</p>

                <p>After walking through the many grand rooms, arched walkways, chandeliers, and walls adorned with thousands of paintings and elaborate spiral gold encrusted carvings I had finally made it to the Hall of Mirrors. The reflection of the mirrors on both sides of the nave-like hall gave the appearance of room and space-- an airy-like quality compared to the other 700 rooms. I walked straight to the back with my head tilted up starring in awe at the grand chandeliers and more High French art. I cocked my head to the left and I looked myself in the eye in Baroque mirrors stained with age and time. “I’m really here.” I was surrounded by Peter Paul Rubens paintings of topless, white, and shapely women. I then began inspecting my sweat-drenched white tank top, my flabby and sun-tanned arms, my freckled sun kissed face, and my combat boots that walked me through a city full of history.</p>

                <div class="quote-bar"></div>
                <p class="quote">Why did I hate this body so much?</p>
                <div class="quote-bar"></div>

                <p>It got me here, it walked me through cities of antiquity, held me upright in my able-bodied existence, enjoyed and digested that green macaron from La Parisienne that Sarah and I couldn’t shut up about all trip. It was an airy and moist cookie of pistachio topped with fresh raspberries and a mousse-like ganache center. What was it about the female form that made it hard to be a female during this day in age? Why did it feel unsafe on the train ride here? Why did it feel unsafe to just be? I wasn’t the one that taught myself to pick this body apart. It was learned from everything around me, from my family, from the very art that adorned the walls of Versailles. Yet, here Venus was, topless, with men fiending for her pudginess. Maybe I just had to own it? I just had to be my own version of Venus for myself. Even the self-titled Sun God himself had a grandiose sense of vanity during the 16th century.</p>

                <p>Living in the age of selfies, I took out my phone and shot a mirror picture of myself. I was proud in that moment. I never took selfies or full body shots. What I saw in my brain did not match what I saw in the mirrors. The average woman in the U.S. wore a size 14 or above, yet we are inundated with unrealistic forms and photoshopped bodies and Kardashian sized asses. I was treating myself like I was something grotesque. Like the size of my pants held some sort of validity over my worth. Throughout history, the archetype of the Goddess has always been depicted as a full-figured woman or pregnant. She was in her power like Kali, she was balanced and giving like Gaia, but most importantly, she was the embodiment of all facets of love and beauty like Venus.</p>

                <p>It was the middle of the night once we made it back to the 5th arrondissement where our Airbnb was located. Dog tired, achy, and hungry we passed by endless bars and the Archangel Michael fountain, the first landmark to let us know we were nearby our “home.” We were both silent for most of the journey back focusing on the landmarks that pointed us closer and closer to a shower, our beds, and food. I could see the dreaded hill and Sarah said, “There it is, we’re almost home.” We climbed it like some bouldering veterans on a trip to Mt. Everest. It took everything in me to make it to the top. I straightened my back and took a deep breath, one block over, our Airbnb with its large oversized windows and green door. We both began to walk a little faster out of anticipation. Upon crossing the block between street bar and comfort, a small dark-haired young man in a leather jacket comes prancing out of a bar and stops us mid-step.</p>

                <div class="quote-bar"></div>
                <p class="quote">“Hi girls! Come drink, come drink!”</p>
                <div class="quote-bar"></div>

                <p>“No thank you. We’re tired” I say, losing my patience. Sarah was the nicer one, she said it has to do with being Southern, but I had zero patience for not saying what I mean and appeasing others. She started to giggle because she knew I was annoyed, and he began asking her questions like :</p>

                <div class="quote-bar"></div>
                <p class="quote">“Where are you two from? Oh, America. Did you vote for Trump? Why is he President? Do you want to have a drink? Come have a drink. I know who you are. I saw you this morning. I work across the street at the store. Window was open, I saw you doing your hair. I can never forget blonde hair.”</p>

                <p>This all occurred about 10 steps away from our flat, but it felt like I was miles away from my safe haven.</p>
                <p>“Uh-huh, cool. Yea you work across the street? Ok, goodnight!” She hit my arm which was our signal to let the other know: “It’s time to go, this is weird, or dangerous, or I feel uncomfortable”. I understood the signal loud and clear and I unlocked the door to the building, made her go in before me. He was still asking us questions and trying to barge in. I finally turned to him, took my back pack off and stood up straight. “No.” He was taken aback. I shut the door on his face as Sarah frantically opened the door to our flat. We burst in, switched on the lights, and threw our backpacks up against the door. We stared at each other in silence for a bit. We heard a knock at the window. The damn window that gave it all away. She tip-toed over and shut the light off. We started to laugh nervously, but I was angry. It took him about 5 minutes to leave after many generous offers of weed, cigarettes, and wine.</p>
                <p>It was about 3 a.m. in the morning and I was almost fast asleep on the loft bed, while Sarah was asleep downstairs on the other. I woke up to the sounds of moans and a man speaking slurred French. Sarah awoke before me. I peered down the loft and could see her round blue- eyes wide-open looking at me, waiting for me to wake the hell up.</p>
                <p>“Oh my god, is that him again?” I said. She didn’t know. She opened the window and it was a homeless man muttering to himself and pissing on the wall. He didn’t realize he was resting his body on a translucent and blatant 10-foot-tall window. He apologized for the muttering and went on his way. We both agreed to stay up the rest of the night, eat the rest of the food, clean, shower again, and pack for our train out to Brussels, Belgium that was departing in 3 hours. Most importantly, we both agreed to not open the window again, no matter how hot it got inside the flat.</p>
                <p>I personally couldn’t wait to leave the city notoriously known for love, beauty, and the very place that made the King flee from Paris. I had always wanted to come here for its history and architectural genius, but the people made it an awful experience at times. It still didn’t feel like I was quite fleeing though, although it may have seemed that way after that night with the stalker. What I felt myself fleeing from was my terrible self-image and body hate. I didn’t see my arms as flabby anymore. They helped me swing the heavy green door open during my encounter with the stalker. I didn’t see me knees as decrepit. They helped me climbs stairs, the hill, and took me places I had never stepped in like The Palace of Versailles. My stomach wasn’t this part of my body to feel ashamed of. It insulated my organs, and it kept me safe when my life was crumbling around me. I may have not liked the biological aspect of fight-or-flight and nights of emotional eating, but it didn’t mean that it deserved to be ridiculed.</p>

                <div class="quote-bar"></div>
                <p class="quote">In retrospect, the stranger, his nonchalant and proud voyeurism, the way I felt in my power telling him “No,” my arms, my legs, our beauty-- It all made me feel like a Goddess, like Venus.</p>
                <div class="quote-bar"></div>

                <p>I could see her in my mind’s eye sitting on that cloud in pastel blues and pinks, arms spread open, breast exposed, confidence exuding. It was like she was smiling down on me letting me know, it’s okay to be me.</p>
